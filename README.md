# Simple Weather App

This Simple Weather App is a project that demonstrates how to build a weather dashboard using basic web technologies (HTML and CSS) and consume a public weather API. The app lets users enter a city name and view current weather data including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

## Features

- Search for the current weather by city name
- Displays temperature, humidity, and weather description
- Clean, responsive layout using HTML and CSS
- Fetches data from a weather API using JavaScript (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API)
- Error handling for invalid city names or network issues

## How It Works

1. User enters a city name in the input field.
2. The app sends a request to the public weather API endpoint.
3. The API responds with weather data in JSON format.
4. The app parses the response and displays the relevant information on the page.

This project demonstrates an understanding of how to interact with RESTful APIs, handle asynchronous requests, and dynamically update the DOM with fetched data.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RickyJasonVanderheyden/Simple-Weather-App.git
   cd Simple-Weather-App
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. (Optional) To use your own API key, sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and update the API key in the JavaScript code.

## Example Usage

- Enter "London" and click "Search" to see London's current weather.
